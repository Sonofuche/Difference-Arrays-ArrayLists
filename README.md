In Java, arrays and ArrayList are both used to store collections of elements, but they differ significantly in structure and flexibility. An array is a fixed-size container that holds elements of the same data type. Once an array is created (for example, new int[5]), its size cannot be changed. Elements are accessed using an index, such as scores[0]. Arrays are efficient and straightforward when the number of elements is known in advance. According to Oracle (n.d.-a), arrays contain a fixed number of elements, and their size cannot be modified after creation.
In contrast, an ArrayList is part of the Java Collections Framework and is designed to be dynamically resizable. You can add or remove elements during program execution using methods like add(), remove(), and get(). Oracle (n.d.-b) describes ArrayList as a resizable-array implementation of the List interface. Its internal capacity automatically increases as elements are added, making it more flexible than a traditional array. This flexibility makes ArrayList especially useful when working with user input or situations where the number of elements may change.
Conceptually, the main difference lies in size management and data handling. Arrays use the length property to determine size, while ArrayLists use the size() method. Arrays can store primitive data types directly (such as int or double), whereas ArrayLists store objects, meaning primitive types must be wrapped using classes like Integer through autoboxing (Horstmann, 2019). In terms of performance, arrays can be slightly faster due to their fixed size and lower overhead, while ArrayList provides convenience and flexibility. Choosing between them depends on whether fixed efficiency or dynamic resizing is more important for the project.
